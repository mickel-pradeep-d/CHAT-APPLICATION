## **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

**TITLE : Real-time Chat Application**

This is a **real-time chat application** built using **Socket.io**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and a frontend powered by **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The application allows users to join a public chatroom and exchange messages with real-time updates.  

## **Features**  
- **Real-time messaging** with instant message delivery.  
- **Full-screen responsive UI** for an immersive experience.  
- **Dynamic user-specific message colors** for easy differentiation.

- **System messages** when users join or leave the chat.  
- **Timestamps on messages** with a small and subtle display.  
- **Smooth animations and a modern UI design.**  
- **Users can join existing chatrooms** by entering the same room name as previous users.  

## **Project Overview**  
This chat application enables users to join a shared chatroom by entering their **name** and **room name**. Each user is assigned a **unique color** to make their messages easily identifiable. Messages are displayed in a **chat format**, ensuring a user-friendly experience.  

Additionally, **new users can join an existing chatroom** simply by entering the same room name as previous users, allowing seamless group conversations.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io  
- **Real-time Communication:** Socket.io  

## **How It Works?**  
1. Users enter their **name** and **room name** to join the chat.  
2. If the room name is new, a new chatroom is created.  
3. If the room name exists, the user joins the ongoing chat in that room.  
4. Each user gets a **unique color** for their messages.  
5. Messages are displayed in a **structured chat format**.  
6. The chat input box is **fixed at the bottom** to maintain usability.  

## **Future Enhancements**  
- Adding **private chat rooms** for one-on-one messaging.  
- Implementing **emoji support** for a fun chat experience.
